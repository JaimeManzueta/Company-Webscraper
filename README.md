# Objective
I developed a web scraping tool using Beautiful Soup, a Python library, to extract data from tables on Wikipedia. Utilizing the power of Pandas and NumPy,
I processed this data, transforming it into a structured CSV file. Leveraging Matplotlib, another Python library, I then visualized this data by generating informative graphs and charts,
allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the information gleaned from the Wikipedia tables.
